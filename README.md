**OPTIONAl** I left my VSCode settings folder so everyone can have same coding style. If you feel inconvenience about this VSCode setting, just simply replace yours or delete the `.vscode` folder. If you want to use this, you need to install Prettier - Code formatter (11M+ downloaded).

If you have any other questions/concerns, post in in Microsoft Teams so all the team members can see it

Only create pull request into `develop` branch, `master` branch is stable - workable code. Please branch off from `develop` only.
